    <p> This is a smash burger. In order to get this, you take 2.5 ounce balls of meat and smash them. </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pickle juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon diced pickle</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>For the burger seasoning mix:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>For the toppings:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 head green leaf lettuce, washed and dried</li>
      <li>1 medium tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>6 slices American cheese</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>For the smashburger:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound 80/20 ground beef</li>
        <li>4 brioche hamburger buns</li>
        2 tablespoons butter, divided
      </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Make Your Secret Sauce:</h4></li>  
        <p>In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, mustard, pickle juice, and diced pickles. Set aside until you're ready to assemble your burgers.</p>
      <li><h4>Mix Together Burger Seasoning:</h4></li>
        <p>In another small bowl combine the kosher salt, black pepper, and seasoned salt</p>
      <li><h4>Prepare the burgers:</h4></li>
        <p>Loosley divide the ground beef into 4 even balls. Season the balls of beef with 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Don't worry about completely covering them. 
          You can add more seasoning when they are cooking.</p>
      <li><h4>Cook the smashburgers:</h4></li>
        <p>Wrap a heavy skillet (cast iron works well) with some foil, you will use this to smash the burgers. I use a smaller 8-inch cast iron skillet, but any smaller size will work.</p>
        <p>In a large skillet or griddle set over medium-high heat and add one tablespoon of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the beef balls.</p>
        <p>Place the foil wrapped skillet or a spatula over the beef balls and smash them into flat disks. Smash each burger for 10 seconds, one at a time, applying a lot of pressureto it. Repeat until all the burgers are smashed.</p>
      <li><h4>Season burgers with more mix and continue to cook:</h4></li>
        <p>Season the smashburgers with another 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Allow them to continue to cook for about 90 seconds until the juices start to bubble 
           from the burger. Use a sturdy metal spatula to flip the burgers, being sure to scap any caramelization.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Add cheese to the burgers</h4></li>
          <p>After you've flipped the burgers, add cheese and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, until burgers are cooked to desired doneness. The burger is so thint hat there's no 
             need to check temperature. It will be done if the burger has a good caramelization on the outside. You can continue to cook additional time depending on your preference.</p>
        <li><h4>Toast the buns:</h4></li>
          <p>While the burgers cook, toast the buns. In a large skillet over medium heat add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the buns, cut side down and toast for 30 seconds, until golden. 
            Repeat until all buns are toasted.</p>
        <li><h4>Build and serve the smashburgers:</h4></li>
          <p>Build smashburger by adding some sauce, approximately 1 tablespoon, to the bottom of the bun. Add lettuce over the top of the sauce, then add a smashburger, and finally top with sliced red 
             onion and tomato. Continue until all smashburgers are assembled.</p>
             <p>Serve immediately with fries and a cold drink.</p>
